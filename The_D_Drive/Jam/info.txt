Ludum Dare 42: Running out of space:
((memory space))

You're a robot, in a faulty factory, this robot has a very limited memory, once it has been turned on, it started thinking, and thinking produces data, so consumes the memory.
The robot's goal is to solve problems in the factory, and each time the robot solves a problem, it will be awarded with a memory expansion.
Once the factory is all working again, it will produce 1TB memory expansions, the robot will get 1 as a reward, and operate for years without running out of memory.
